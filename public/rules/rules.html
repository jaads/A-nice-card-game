    <h1 class="article-title">The rules</h1>
    <p class="article-meta">Don't worry, the algorithm should be resistant against not allowed moves - so you cannot
        make anything wrong ;)</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>A card with a value from 2 to 14 is placed in the middle. Each player needs to play a card which in general needs
        to have an equivalent or higher value. Meaning that e.g. one can play a 9 on a 9 or a 11 on a 9. It's also
        possible to play multiple cards at once - provided that all cards have the same value and, as mentioned before,
        have at least the same value. You can choose the number of cards you want to play after clicking of one.
        If a player cannot make a move, meaning that the player does not have a higher or equivalent card, the player
        needs to pick up all cards from the stack and add them to its own cards.</p>

    <p>Goal of the game is to <u>get rid of all cards</u> a player has. Here, the different stages are of interest.
        They mainly describe the order in which the players cards need to be played.
        Also, the cards of one stage can be seen by all other players.</p>

    <h2>The different stages</h2>
    <p>At the beginning, each player has nine cards in total divided in three stages.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Three cards on a players "hand": only viewable by the player who owns the cards.</li>
        <li>Three cards faced-up: viewable by all players.</li>
        <li>Three cards faced-down: successively viewable only by the player in the very end.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A player needs to begin with the cards on the first stage and finishes the game by having played all cards
        from the third stage. If a player has to pick up the stack, these cards are added to the first stage.</p>
    <p>When a player plays a card and has less then three cards on the hand, the player gets a new card from
        the deck until the deck is empty.</p>

    <p>So far, so good, right? Let's introduce some <u>special cards</u> so you don't get bored.</p>

    <h2>Special cards</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>2</b>: Resets the current value of the stack. Meaning if a 12 is the current card and one plays a 2,
            then the next player could again play e.g. a 4. </li>
        <li><b>3</b>: Behaves like no cards was played. the current value of the stack is the same as before the 3
            was played.</li>
        <li><b>7</b>: Here, instead of playing a greater value, a smaller value needs to be played, e.g. a 5. Note:
            The same card could be played anyways, hence a 7 on a 7 in valid.</li>
        <li><b>8</b>: The next player needs to take a small break.</li>
        <li><b>10</b>: The stack gets burned. Meaning the stack is out of the game and none needs to pick them up.
        </li>
    </ul>
